# Final presentation of the QA Automation course

You are in the official presentation of the last weekly problem of the 15-week course carried out with the Radium Rocket team.

## Terms

For this problem we had to apply everything we learned throughout the course, mainly the last weeks where we were able to learn to perform tests and automate those that require it.

## Necessary steps

In order to solve it, we first download Node.js and then all the add-ons that are necessary to run the tests, such as the JSON package and the WEBDRIVER.IO, with their corresponding add-ons.

## Context and order

The page that we had to test is one that is prepared for this purpose, in this case: https://www.saucedemo.com.

The same account with the access of only 4 users (and a single password) where each one presents different characteristics to be tested.

Based on them, in this work the files were arranged according to the order of said users, using the alphabet letters as a guide and order.

Therefore, when running the tests, they will be done in an orderly manner.

A max instance of 10 simultaneous tests was chosen to shorten the times but if you want to observe the running of each one in particular, you must change that number to 1.

## Is required

To run this test, in addition to referring to the point "Necessary steps" previously explained, you must enter a terminal and write the following in it:

[npm run test]

With this, the tests created for each of the users will automatically start to run.
